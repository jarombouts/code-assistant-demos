    "- You can also guide it by creating a comment indicating what you want to do, press enter and wait\n",
    "    - As the comments are already placed for this exercise: place your cursor at the end of each comment and press enter, and wait for the code suggestion\n",
    "- If there is a suggestion, you can press Tab to accept it\n",
